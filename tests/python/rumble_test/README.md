# Rumble Detector Tests
All of the expirements run in this folder are run using Jesse's elephant rumble training data.

The expirements as well as scripts used to run them can be found in `src/` and `scripts/` respectively. The results of the experiments can be found in `expirement-results/`.

Asside from `src/test_rumble_detector.py`, which uses a wider set of minimum frequencies and thresholds, all of the experiments use a minimum frequency of 1 hz and a threshold of 1%.
